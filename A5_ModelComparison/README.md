# Assignment 5: Parameter uncertainty & Model Comparison

The following resources will help you to get ready to complete this assignment. <br>
Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/9JfXKmVB6qc?t=910" target="_blank">the second part of this video</a> to have a quick overview of how to assess model fits. Remember that all types of regression analysis and statistical test can be seen as testing how well a generative model (i.e. a linear model with noise) can explain your data. Then watch these series of short videos on more specific topics (all these videos are taken from the <a href="https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/W1D2_ModelFitting/chapter_title.html" target="_blank">tutorials of the Model Fitting day at Neuromatch Academy</a>):
        <li><a href="https://youtu.be/hs6bVGQNSIs" target="_blank">this video</a> on bootstrapping the estimate the confidence intervals for your model parameters</li>
        <li> <a href="https://youtu.be/NcUH_seBcVw" target="_blank">this video</a> on the bias-variance trade-off, which provides the conceptual basis for model selection, i.e. finding a model that fits the data well while keeping model complexity as low as possible. For statistical analysis, this is equivalent to look for the significant effects as components that we must include in the model in order to capture the structure of the data.</li>
        <li> <a href="https://youtu.be/OtKw0rSRxo4" target="_blank">this video</a> about how to perform model comparison in practice by testing the model on a test set (i.e. a part of the dataset that was not used for estimating the parameters), and how this is generalized in <b>cross-validation</b></li>
