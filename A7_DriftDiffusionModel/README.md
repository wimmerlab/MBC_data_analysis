# Assignment 7: the Drift-Diffusion Model

In this assignment, we will study how the Drift-Diffusion Model to capture choices and reaction times in (speeded) decision-making tasks. We will :
- **simulate** the drift-diffusion model to understand the impact of its parameters on the pattern of choices and reaction times,
- **fit** the drift-diffusion model to behavioral data from monkeys performing a motion discrimination task

You can prepare for the assignment by reading the following review: Ratcliff, Smith et al., *Trends in Cognitive Sciences*, 2016 ([pdf](https://bpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/u.osu.edu/dist/6/60429/files/2018/09/trends16-1p31ugz.pdf))
