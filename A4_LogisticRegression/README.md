## Assignment 4: Logistic regression and interaction terms

**In this assignment, we will see how to study binary decisions with logistic regression models:**
- using **logistic regression** (one form of Generalized Linear Model) to describe how decisions depend on a set of experimental factors (and their **interactions**)
- using **generalized linear mixed models** (GLMM) to capture the heterogeneity of behavior across the population

<b>Preparing for this assignment:</b> 

The following resources will help you to get ready to complete this assignment. 
<ul>
        <li>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSHcIHMxhbE" target="_blank">this video</a> to see a step-by-step construction of a multiple linear model with interaction terms. Make sure you understand the logic of the interaction explained in the last half of the video. Take the exercise at the end of the video by stopping the video while you make your calculations.</li>
    <li>Browse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_(statistics)" target="_blank">this Wikipedia page</a> about interactions. It focuses a lot on ANOVAs, which we do not plan to address directly, so do not focus too much on that. I suggest reading the introduction, the <i>"In regression"</i> subsection and the <i>"Examples"</i> subsection. </li>
    <li>OPTIONAL: If you were wondering why we skip ANOVAs and are happy just with linear models, ANOVA being such a popular statistical tool, <a href="https://eigenfoo.xyz/tests-as-linear/" target="_blank">here</a> is a more advanced Python document for you to make the point that linear models are a very general framework, which includes many of the classical statistical tests (also ANOVAs). We can run all our tests with linear models!!
