# Assignment 6: Advanced topics in regression

In this assignment, we will:
- study how the estimated weights of a regression model change when introducing a correlated regressor, and understand what that means for **introducing nuisance regressors**,
- study why a **regression model cannot include colinear regressors**
- see how we **detect colinear or strongly correlated regressors** that could affect estimation of weights, using the **Variance Inflation Factor**,
- study how we can determine in advance if our sample size is adequate to find a statistical significant effect, using simulation-based power analysis.

You can prepare for the assignment by watching the following videos: 
- [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA5UJYRyju0) on multicollinearity and the Variance Inflation Factor. You can also have a look at [this other video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cba9LJ9lS8s) which presents the same concept at a slower pace.
- these two videos from StatQuest on power analysis: [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFhJefdVCjE) about p-hacking and statistical power, [second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX_M3tIyiYk) about power analysis
