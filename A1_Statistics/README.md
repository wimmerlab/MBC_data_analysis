## Assignment 1: descriptive statistics and parametric vs non-parametric methods
In this assignment, we will see:
- how to visually inspect experimental data
- how to characterize experimental data using descriptive statistics
- how to perform a simple statistic test using either a parametric (t-test) or non-parametric (shuffling) method

<b>Preparing for this assignment:</b> 

The following resources will help you to get ready to complete this assignment. 
<ul>
    <li>Watch <a href="http://youtu.be/5q-Ws4y8JE4" target="_blank">this video</a> (here the <a href="https://www.cmrr.umn.edu/~kendrick/statsmatlab/StatsLecture2Slides_Hypothesis.pdf" target="_blank">slides</a>) only until time stamp 23:08 (stop right after permutation tests) in order to learn about:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>the logic of t-tests to test the hypothesis that two samples have the same mean</li>
        <li>the non-parametric equivalent in permutation tests. Make sure you understand this logic</li>
    </ul>
